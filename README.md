## How will you create theme from this ?

##### Step 1:
- Create a folder in `themes/`, let's say `mytheme`

##### Step 2:
- Copy `layouts` and `static` folder into `mytheme`

Delete contents of layouts and static now. Now we don't need that
##### Step 3:
- Add to your `config.toml` the line:

```toml
theme = "mytheme"
```
